				<h1>Snowtiger</h1>
				<p>Snowtiger was the third cat we had gotten. He is still alive and well, but just very grumpy and hangs around outside a lot to greet our neighbors. The first two cats we had were named Booger and Slipper.</p>

				<h1>Firestar</h1>
				<p>Firestar is our fourth cat. He is an indoor-cat, so he isn't allowed outside. His breed is a Scottish Fold, but he has pointed ears. He's very friendly, but he's also very shy when it comes to meeting new people.</p>

				<h1>Huepow</h1>
				<p>Huepow is my pet snake. He enjoys sleeping in his log or sleeping under the carpet in his tank (I have no clue how he gets in and out, but he does). He also enjoys being taken out of his tank so much that he gets stubborn and refuses to go back in when I try to put him back.</p>

				<h1>Jayzix</h1>
				<p>Our latest addition to the family, Jayzix. She had a previous owner who she somehow ran away from. We couldn't reach the owner, so she stays with us now. Her previous name was Charlotte.</p>
